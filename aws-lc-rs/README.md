# AWS Libcrypto for Rust (aws-lc-rs)

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-aws%2Faws--lc--rs-blue)](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs)

A [*ring*](https://github.com/briansmith/ring)-compatible crypto library using the cryptographic
operations provided by [*AWS-LC*](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc). It uses either the
auto-generated [*aws-lc-sys*](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-sys) or
[*aws-lc-fips-sys*](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-fips-sys)
Foreign Function Interface (FFI) crates found in this repository for invoking *AWS-LC*.

## Build

`aws-lc-rs` is available through [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs). It can
be added to your project in the [standard way](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html)
using `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-lc-rs = "1.0.0"
```

Consuming projects will need a C Compiler (Clang or GCC) to build.
For some platforms, the build may also require CMake.
Building with the "fips" feature on any platform requires **CMake** and **Go**.

See our [User Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/) for guidance on installing build requirements.

## Feature Flags

##### alloc (default)

Allows implementation to allocate values of arbitrary size. (The meaning of this feature differs
from the "alloc" feature of *ring*.) Currently, this is required by the `io::writer` module.

##### ring-io (default)

Enable feature to access the  `io`  module.

##### ring-sig-verify (default)

Enable feature to preserve compatibility with ring's `signature::VerificationAlgorithm::verify`
function. This adds a requirement on `untrusted = "0.7.1"`.

##### fips

Enable this feature to have aws-lc-rs use the [*aws-lc-fips-sys*](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-fips-sys)
crate for the cryptographic implementations. The aws-lc-fips-sys crate provides bindings to the
latest version of the AWS-LC-FIPS module that has completed FIPS validation testing by an
accredited lab and has been submitted to NIST for certification. This will continue to be the
case as we periodically submit new versions of the AWS-LC-FIPS module to NIST for certification.
Currently, aws-lc-fips-sys binds to
[AWS-LC-FIPS 3.0.x](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/tree/fips-2024-09-27).

Consult with your local FIPS compliance team to determine the version of AWS-LC-FIPS module that you require. Consumers
needing to remain on a previous version of the AWS-LC-FIPS module should pin to specific versions of aws-lc-rs to avoid
automatically being upgraded to a newer module version.
(See [cargoâ€™s documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html)
on how to specify dependency versions.)

| AWS-LC-FIPS module | aws-lc-rs |
|--------------------|-----------|
| 2.0.x              | \<1.12.0  |
| 3.0.x              | *latest*  |

Refer to the
[NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program's Modules In Progress List](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List)
for the latest status of the static or dynamic AWS-LC Cryptographic Module. Please see the
[FIPS.md in the aws-lc repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/blob/main/crypto/fipsmodule/FIPS.md)
for relevant security policies and information on supported operating environments.
We will also update our release notes and documentation to reflect any changes in FIPS certification status.

##### asan

Performs an "address sanitizer" build. This can be used to help detect memory leaks. See the
["Address Sanitizer" section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/compiler-flags/sanitizer.html#addresssanitizer)
of the [Rust Unstable Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/).

##### bindgen

Causes `aws-lc-sys` or `aws-lc-fips-sys` to generates fresh bindings for AWS-LC instead of using
the pre-generated bindings. This feature requires `libclang` to be installed. See the
[requirements](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)
for [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)

##### prebuilt-nasm

Enables the use of crate provided prebuilt NASM objects under certain conditions. This only affects builds for
Windows x86-64 platforms. This feature is ignored if the "fips" feature is also enabled.

Use of prebuilt NASM objects is prevented if either of the following conditions are true:
* The NASM assembler is detected in the build environment
* `AWS_LC_SYS_PREBUILT_NASM` environment variable is set with a value of `0`

Be aware that [features are additive](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification);
by enabling this feature, it is enabled for all crates within the same build.

## Use of prebuilt NASM objects

For Windows x86 and x86-64, NASM is required for assembly code compilation. On these platforms,
we recommend that you install [the NASM assembler](https://www.nasm.us/). If NASM is
detected in the build environment *it is used* to compile the assembly files. However,
if a NASM assembler is not available, and the "fips" feature is not enabled, then the build fails unless one of the following conditions are true:

* You are building for `x86-64` and either:
   * The `AWS_LC_SYS_PREBUILT_NASM` environment variable is found and has a value of "1"; OR
   * `AWS_LC_SYS_PREBUILT_NASM` is *not found* in the environment AND the "prebuilt-nasm" feature has been enabled.

If the above cases apply, then the crate provided prebuilt NASM objects will be used for the build. To prevent usage of prebuilt NASM
objects, install NASM in the build environment and/or set the variable `AWS_LC_SYS_PREBUILT_NASM` to `0` in the build environment to prevent their use.

### About prebuilt NASM objects

Prebuilt NASM objects are generated using automation similar to the crate provided pregenerated bindings. See the repositories
[GitHub workflow configuration](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs/blob/main/.github/workflows/sys-bindings-generator.yml) for more information.
The prebuilt NASM objects are checked into the repository
and are [available for inspection](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs/tree/main/aws-lc-sys/builder/prebuilt-nasm).
For each PR submitted,
[CI verifies](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs/blob/8fb6869fc7bde92529a5cca40cf79513820984f7/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L209-L241)
that the NASM objects newly built from source match the NASM objects currently in the repository.

## *ring*-compatibility

Although this library attempts to be fully compatible with *ring* (v0.16.x), there are a few places where our
behavior is observably different.

* Our implementation requires the `std` library. We currently do not support a
  [`#![no_std]`](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html) build.
* We can only support a subset of the platforms supported by `aws-lc-sys`. See the list of
  supported platforms above.
* `Ed25519KeyPair::from_pkcs8` and `Ed25519KeyPair::from_pkcs8_maybe_unchecked` both support
  parsing of v1 or v2 PKCS#8 documents. If a v2 encoded key is provided to either function,
  public key component, if present, will be verified to match the one derived from the encoded
  private key.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

Details on the post-quantum algorithms supported by aws-lc-rs can be found at
[PQREADME](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/tree/main/crypto/fipsmodule/PQREADME.md).

## Motivation

Rust developers increasingly need to deploy applications that meet US and Canadian government
cryptographic requirements. We evaluated how to deliver FIPS validated cryptography in idiomatic
and performant Rust, built around our AWS-LC offering. We found that the popular ring (v0.16)
library fulfilled much of the cryptographic needs in the Rust community, but it did not meet the
needs of developers with FIPS requirements. Our intention is to contribute a drop-in replacement
for ring that provides FIPS support and is compatible with the ring API. Rust developers with
prescribed cryptographic requirements can seamlessly integrate aws-lc-rs into their applications
and deploy them into AWS Regions.
