# AWS Libcrypto for Rust (aws-lc-rs)

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-awslabs%2Faws--lc--rs-blue)](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc-rs)

A [*ring*](https://github.com/briansmith/ring)-compatible crypto library using the cryptographic
operations provided by [*AWS-LC*](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc). It uses either the
auto-generated [*aws-lc-sys*](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-sys) or [*aws-lc-fips-sys*](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-fips-sys)
Foreign Function Interface (FFI) crates found in this repository for invoking *AWS-LC*.

## Build

`aws-lc-rs` is available through [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs). It can
be added to your project in the [standard way](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html)
using `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aws-lc-rs = "1.0.0"
```
Consuming projects will need a C Compiler (Clang or GCC) and Cmake to build.

**Requirements**:
* C compiler (Clang or GCC or Visual Studio Build Tools 2017)
* Cmake (>= v3.12)
* Linux or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) or Windows

**Platform- and Feature-specific Requirements**
  * Linux - required for `fips`
  * [Go](https://go.dev/) - required for `fips`
  * [libclang](https://llvm.org/) - required for `bindgen` and for any platform lacking pre-generated bindings (like Windows or M1 Macs)

See our [User Guide](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lc-rs/) for guidance on installing these requirements.


## Feature Flags

##### - alloc (default) ####
Allows implementation to allocate values of arbitrary size. (The meaning of this feature differs
from the "alloc" feature of *ring*.) Currently, this is required by the `io::writer` module.

##### - ring-io (default) ####
Enable feature to access the  `io`  module.

##### - ring-sig-verify (default) ####
Enable feature to preserve compatibility with ring's `signature::VerificationAlgorithm::verify`
function. This adds a requirement on `untrusted = "0.7.1"`.

##### - fips ####
**EXPERIMENTAL** Enable this feature to have aws-lc-rs use the
[*aws-lc-fips-sys*](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-fips-sys) crate for the cryptographic
implementations. The *aws-lc-fips-sys* crate provides bindings to the FIPS variant of
[*AWS-LC*](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc). AWS-LC has been submitted to an accredited lab
for FIPS validation testing, and upon completion will be submitted to NIST for certification.
Once NIST grants a validation certificate to AWS-LC, we will make an announcement to Rust
developers on how to leverage the FIPS mode. This feature is currently only available on Linux.

##### - asan ####
Performs an "address sanitizer" build. This can be used to help detect memory leaks. See the
["Address Sanitizer" section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/compiler-flags/sanitizer.html#addresssanitizer)
of the [Rust Unstable Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/).

##### - bindgen ####
Causes `aws-lc-sys` or `aws-lc-fips-sys` to generates fresh bindings for AWS-LC instead of using
the pre-generated bindings. This feature requires `libclang` to be installed. See the
[requirements](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)
for [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)

## *ring*-compatibility

Although this library attempts to be fully compatible with *ring*, there are a few places where our
behavior is observably different.

* Our implementation requires the `std` library. We currently do not support a
[`#![no_std]`](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html) build.
* We can only support a subset of the platforms supported by `aws-lc-sys`. See the list of
supported platforms above.
* `Ed25519KeyPair::from_pkcs8` and `Ed25519KeyPair::from_pkcs8_maybe_unchecked` both support
parsing of v1 or v2 PKCS#8 documents. If a v2 encoded key is provided to either function,
public key component, if present, will be verified to match the one derived from the encoded
private key.

## Motivation

Rust developers increasingly need to deploy applications that meet US and Canadian government
cryptographic requirements. We evaluated how to deliver FIPS validated cryptography in idiomatic
and performant Rust, built around our AWS-LC offering. We found that the popular ring (v0.16)
library fulfilled much of the cryptographic needs in the Rust community, but it did not meet the
needs of developers with FIPS requirements. Our intention is to contribute a drop-in replacement
for ring that provides FIPS support and is compatible with the ring API. Rust developers with
prescribed cryptographic requirements can seamlessly integrate aws-lc-rs into their applications
and deploy them into AWS Regions.


### Contributor Quickstart for Amazon Linux 2023

For those who would like to contribute to our project or build it directly from our repository,
a few more packages may be needed. The listing below shows the steps needed for you to begin
building and testing our project locally.
```shell
# Install dependencies needed for build and testing
sudo yum install -y cmake3 clang git clang-libs golang openssl-devel

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Clone and initialize a local repository
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc-rs.git
cd aws-lc-rs
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build and test the project
cargo test

```

Otherwise, if you think you might have found a security impacting issue, please instead
follow our *Security Notification Process* below.

## Security Notification Process

If you discover a potential security issue in *AWS-LC* or *aws-lc-rs*, we ask that you notify AWS
Security via our
[vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).
Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.
