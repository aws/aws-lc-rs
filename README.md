# aws-lc-ring
*aws-lc-ring* is a cryptographic library using [AWS-LC](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc) for its cryptographic operations.
This library strives to be API-compatible with the popular Rust library named 
[ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring).

## Build
See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for instructions on building.

### Feature Flags
* `alloc` (*default*)
Allows implementation to allocate values of unbounded size. (The meaning of this feature differs from the “alloc” 
feature of *ring*.) Currently, this is only required by the `io::writer` module.

* `ring-io` (*default*)
Enable feature to access the io module.

* `asan`
Performs an “address sanitizer” build of AWS-LC. This can be used to help detect memory leaks. See the 
“[Sanitizer](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/compiler-flags/sanitizer.html)” 
section of the Rust Unstable Book.

* `bindgen`
Enables generation and building of the `aws-lc-sys` dependency crate on platforms not provided with pre-generated bindings.

## *ring*-compatibility

Although this library attempts to be fully compatible with *ring*, there are a few places where our behavior is 
observably different.

* Our implementation requires the `std` library. We currently do not support a `#![no_std]` build.
* We can only support a subset of the platforms supported by [`aws-lc-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-sys). We currently support Mac and Linux, both 
x86-64 and aarch64.
* Due to its dependence on AWS-LC, this library does not support generating or parsing PKCS#8 v2. 
Thus, the `Ed25519KeyPair::generate_pkcs8` and `Ed25519KeyPair::from_pkcs8` implementations always returns an error. 
Instead, you can use `Ed25519KeyPair::generate_pkcs8v1` for generating and `Ed25519KeyPair::from_pkcs8_maybe_unchecked`
for parsing PKCS#8 v1.
* When parsing fails, the `KeyRejected` response may differ from *ring*’s response on the same input.
