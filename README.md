# AWS Libcrypto for Rust

[*aws-lc-rs*](aws-lc-rs/README.md) is a cryptographic library using [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc) for its
cryptographic operations.
This library strives to be API-compatible with the popular Rust library named
[ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) (v0.16). It uses either the auto-generated
[*aws-lc-sys*](aws-lc-sys/README.md) or
[*aws-lc-fips-sys*](aws-lc-fips-sys/README.md) Foreign Function Interface (FFI) crates found in this
repository for invoking *AWS-LC*.

## Crates

### [aws-lc-rs](aws-lc-rs/README.md)

A *ring*-compatible crypto library using the cryptographic operations provided by
[*AWS-LC*](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc) using either *aws-lc-sys* or *aws-lc-fips-sys*.

### [aws-lc-sys](aws-lc-sys/README.md)

**Autogenerated** Low-level AWS-LC bindings for the Rust programming language.
We do not recommend directly relying on these bindings.

### [aws-lc-fips-sys](aws-lc-fips-sys/README.md)

**Autogenerated** Low-level AWS-LC bindings for the Rust programming language, providing FIPS support.
We do not recommend directly relying on these bindings. This crate provides bindings to
[AWS-LC-FIPS 2.x](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/tree/fips-2022-11-02), which has completed
FIPS validation testing by an accredited lab and has been submitted to NIST for certification. The static build of
AWS-LC-FIPS
is used. (See [README](./aws-lc-fips-sys/README.md)).

Refer to the
[NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program's Modules In Progress List](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List)
for the latest status of the static or dynamic AWS-LC Cryptographic Module. A complete list of supported operating
environments will be made available in the vendor security policy once the validation certificate has been issued. We
will also update our release notes and documentation to reflect any changes in FIPS certification status.

## Build

Please see the [build instructions](aws-lc-rs/README.md#Build) in the aws-lc-rs crate.

# Motivation

Rust developers increasingly need to deploy applications that meet US and Canadian government cryptographic
requirements. We evaluated how to deliver FIPS validated cryptography in idiomatic and performant Rust, built around our
AWS-LC offering. We found that the popular ring (v0.16) library fulfilled much of the cryptographic needs in the Rust
community, but it did not meet the needs of developers with FIPS requirements. Our intention is to contribute a drop-in
replacement for ring that provides FIPS support and is compatible with the ring API. Rust developers with prescribed
cryptographic requirements can seamlessly integrate aws-lc-rs into their applications and deploy them into AWS Regions.

Otherwise, if you think you might have found a security impacting issue, please instead
follow our *Security Notification Process* below.

## Security Notification Process

If you discover a potential security issue in *AWS-LC* or *aws-lc-rs*, we ask that you notify AWS
Security via our
[vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).
Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.

If you package or distribute *aws-lc-rs*, or use *aws-lc-rs* as part of a large multi-user service,
you may be eligible for pre-notification of future *aws-lc-rs* releases.
Please contact aws-lc-pre-notifications@amazon.com.
