# AWS Libcrypto for Rust
[*aws-lc-rs*](aws-lc-rs/README.md) is a cryptographic library using [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc) for its
cryptographic operations.
This library strives to be API-compatible with the popular Rust library named
[ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring). It uses either the auto-generated [*aws-lc-sys*](aws-lc-sys/README.md) or [
*aws-lc-fips-sys*](aws-lc-fips-sys/README.md) Foreign Function Interface (FFI) crates found in this
repository for invoking *AWS-LC*.

## Crates

### [aws-lc-rs](aws-lc-rs/README.md)
A *ring*-compatible crypto library using the cryptographic operations provided by
[*AWS-LC*](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc) using either *aws-lc-sys* or *aws-lc-fips-sys*.

### [aws-lc-sys](aws-lc-sys/README.md)
**Autogenerated** Low-level AWS-LC bindings for the Rust programming language.
We do not recommend directly relying on these bindings.

### [aws-lc-fips-sys](aws-lc-fips-sys/README.md)
**Autogenerated** Low-level AWS-LC bindings for the Rust programming language. Providing **experimental** FIPS support.
We do not recommend directly relying on these bindings. This crate
uses [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/tree/fips-2022-11-02),
which been submitted to an accredited lab for FIPS validation testing, and upon completion will be submitted to NIST
for certification. Once NIST grants a validation certificate to AWS-LC, we will make an announcement to Rust developers
on how to leverage the FIPS mode using [aws-lc-rs](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs).

# Motivation
Rust developers increasingly need to deploy applications that meet US and Canadian government cryptographic
requirements. We evaluated how to deliver FIPS validated cryptography in idiomatic and performant Rust, built around our
AWS-LC offering. We found that the popular ring (v0.16) library fulfilled much of the cryptographic needs in the Rust
community, but it did not meet the needs of developers with FIPS requirements. Our intention is to contribute a drop-in
replacement for ring that provides FIPS support and is compatible with the ring API. Rust developers with prescribed
cryptographic requirements can seamlessly integrate aws-lc-rs into their applications and deploy them into AWS Regions.

## Security Notification Process

If you discover a potential security issue in *AWS-LC* or *aws-lc-rs*, we ask that you notify AWS
Security via our
[vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).
Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.

If you package or distribute *aws-lc-rs*, or use *aws-lc-rs* as part of a large multi-user service,
you may be eligible for pre-notification of future *aws-lc-rs* releases.
Please contact aws-lc-pre-notifications@amazon.com.
